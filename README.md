Using A* to find the shortest route

Problem
In 402 BC, Goth people that was led by Alaric came to invade a Roman Empire territory. To face that invasion, Roman emperor Honorius
moved west capital city from Milan city to Ravenna city. After many fierce battles occured between the two parties, at last the armies of
emperor Honorius were defeated. Then the empire's territory was full of Alaric and his armies. Meanwhile the rest of Roman soldiers that
were in Bobbia city and led by Flavius Aetius tried to go back to capital city Ravenna. The only hope was going through rivers, because
Ravenna city was located at coastal areas and was passed by many rivers, and the entire grounds had been controlled by Alaric. Help
Aetius to find the most optimal(shortest) river route to arrive to Ravenna city by using A* algorithm.
